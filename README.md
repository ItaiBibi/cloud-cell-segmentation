1. Introduction.

Implementation of several schemes for the task of cloud cells segmentation. These schemes suit images of clouds taken from above. Aircrafts, UAV and all satellite imagery in the visible included. These schemes were designed and tested for the segmentation of Marine Stratocumulus (MSc) clouds. With minor adjustments these implementations can be adopted for other cloudy scenes and achieve good accuracy.

If you use any of the implementations in this Toolbox, we appreciate it if you cite an appropriate subset of the following papers:
